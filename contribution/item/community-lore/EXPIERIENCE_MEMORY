It looks like a small shard, disjointed from a mirror.
But it’s surface does not show the reflection of it’s holder. It shows something familiar and strange simultaneously.
A fragment of experience which was experienced before from an alternative me.
Long ago and far away from a parallel universe which happens now and here at the same time.
Only the holders brain chosen from the shard merges with the knowledge.
